# Trite

[(Merriam-Webster)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trite) Trite: (adj.) Hackneyed or boring from much use : not fresh or original.

Trite is a collection of CSS and Javascript that I have used many times over in a handful of websites or web pages. 
Previously, these lines of code were scattered across various different scripts. 
Here, they will be consolidated into a couple of scripts that can be downloaded and plugged into a project.
Anyone is free to use them for personal or commercial projects at no cost, as they are under the MIT license.

I have also expanded the scripts to contain other things that should hopefully make future projects even easier for me.

**Trite.css**

To use the CSS, you could simply use the minified version to get the basics. If you would rather use it as a template to build off of,
make sure to download the non-minified version and minify it once you are done. <ins>**The non-minified template contains many empty fields that
you should remove prior to minifying, in case the minifier does not remove them for you!**</ins>

The template checks whether the user prefers dark or light UI, so you can build your template around that and change the colors to suit your liking.
In time, I'd like to make this more of a complete design template that might lean towards a particular web page design.

**Trite.js**

The Javascript files contain basic utilities that automate the most common Javascript tasks I have. These include selecting an element by ID or class,
getting attribute values, setting CSS, and setting the footer. Use the minified version if you need something to throw into your project and quickly use.
Use the non-minified version if you want to build off of the script and add to it. You could also use it to see how things work under the hood or to get
a better idea how things are meant to be used.

**Testing.js**

I'm not sure why I made this, actually. I think I got a bit carried away and made it for no particular reason. I had to strip it out of trite.js because
it really doesn't belong there. I might just get rid of it altogether if I never end up using it.
